## TODO

# High priority

- [ ] "Add New Set" Dialog should use the last set values as initial value
- [ ] Save/Load Workout Templates
- [ ] Duplicate Set (Copy/paste a previously made set)
- [ ] Display workoutName in HomePage Workout Card (The name can come from the template)
- [ ] "Add New Set" Dialog should have a row with "+Drop" buttons. Clicking the button reveals a place to add weight + reps for that drop.
- [ ] Make it clear that the Workout Card (and all cards) can be long pressed.

# Low priority / long term goals

- [ ] Advanced workout calendar showing decorations on dates with workouts / planned workouts
- [ ] Workout scheduling (using create new routine) - Look at Runna App for inspiration. Use a calendar plugin.
- [ ] Make it clear that you can scroll left and right in the home page. Perhaps a Runna style calendar bar at the top?
- [ ] Add a new home page, and rename the current home page to WorkoutCarousel
